    <p>As a world traveller,these are a couple of my favorite places to visit, I hope your travels are as amazing as mine have been. The world is your oyster.</p>
    <h2 class="destination">1.Cairo Egypt</h2>
    <div class="description">The area that would become Cairo was part of ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are near-by. Located near the Nile Delta,[6][7] the predecessor settlement was Fustat following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Subsequently, Cairo was founded by the Fatimid dynasty in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (12th‚Äì16th centuries).[8]

        Cairo has since become a longstanding centre of political and cultural life, and is titled "the city of a thousand minarets" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979.[9] Cairo is considered a World City with a "Beta +" classification according to GaWC.[10]
        
        Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industry in the Arab world, as well as Egypt's oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organizations have regional headquarters in the city; the Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.
        
        Cairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic. The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, is the oldest metro system in Africa,[11] and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world,[12] with over 1 billion[13] annual passenger rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005,[14] and 43rd globally on Foreign Policy's 2010 Global Cities Index.[15]</div>

     <div class="content">
        <p>If you're thinking of Egypt, you might be conjuring up images of the Pyramids, pharaohs and the Nile.
        At the heart of the country is Cairo. The capital city attracts countless tourists every year, coming to see the Great Pyramids of Giza, the Egyptian Museum and the city's other splendors. It's a famously hot and busy place, and to experience everything it has to offer to the fullest, there are certain times of the year that are better for visiting than others.</p>

<p>Whatever it is you‚Äôre after, plan the perfect time for your trip to Cairo with this seasonal guide.
October to December is best if you want to avoid the infamous heat
Average daytime temperatures are the coolest they will be all year in the months of October, November and December, and the evenings usher in refreshing breezes. However, it‚Äôs also prime tourist season in Cairo as visitors flock here to go sightseeing while the temperatures are cooler. As a result, there‚Äôs a surge in flight and hotel prices, particularly around the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>While visiting at this time of year is tempting because of the weather, keep in mind that the main attractions will be busy, and you'll need to book flights and hotels at least two months in advance to ensure decent prices and availability.</p>

<p>Sandstorms are a possibility in March
Early March is a less busy time to visit Cairo and the weather is pleasant, but it‚Äôs also the month where sandstorms are most likely to occur. This is when wind blows from the desert in the south, circulating hot air and dust ‚Äì very unpleasant, particularly for anyone with asthma. Sightseeing can be disrupted and it's difficult to get from place to place. In extreme cases, flights and river cruises are cancelled.
<p>If you visit Cairo during sandstorm season, pack sunglasses to help keep sand and dirt out of your eyes, and always carry a face mask and a bottle of water.</p>

<h4>Celebrate Sham An Nessim on Easter Monday</h4>
<p>Sham An Nessim is an Egyptian national festival, dating back to at least 2700 BCE, held on Easter Monday to mark the beginning of spring. Ancient Egyptians believed that the festival marked the beginning of world creation, when ‚ÄúRa‚Äù the Sun God sailed with his boat through the skies and landed on the top of the Great Pyramid.</p>  

<p>To celebrate, people paint, decorate and write wishes on eggs before hanging them in baskets in the hope that the wishes will come true. Sham An Nessim celebrations mainly take place in people's homes, but visitors may notice seasonal changes to menus at this time. The dishes most closely associated with Sham An Nessim are feseekh (salted fish eaten with spring onions) and ringa (smoked herring with lemon and onion).
April and May are great months for visiting Cairo
Spring is a magical time to be in Cairo. The winter crowds are less and the weather is gorgeous with average temperatures between 25¬∞C and 32¬∞C (77‚Äì90¬∞F), hotter than it is from October to December but not as hot as it is in the summer. Flight and hotel prices are reasonable at this time.
The summer months of June to September are the hottest time to visit
<p>The summer season in Egypt typically spans from June to September and it can be sweltering, with temperatures ranging from 30¬∞C to 40¬∞C (86‚Äì104¬∞F), occasionally even reaching 50¬∞C (122¬∞F). It‚Äôs the hottest time of the year, with many tourists and locals going to the Red Sea, and not as many visitors in Cairo.</p>
<p>If you do choose to come to Cairo at this time, all is not lost. Certain sights, such as the historic Pyramids of Giza, are best visited early in the morning before the heat takes its toll. Almost all the museums, restaurants, hotels and shops have air-conditioning, helping make the heat manageable. Pack sunglasses, sunscreen and carry a bottle of water with you so you can remain hydrated at all times.</p>

<p>Can I visit Egypt during Ramadan?
As a predominantly Islamic country, Ramadan is one of Egypt‚Äôs most significant events. Held over a month, fasting during Ramadan occurs from sunrise to sunset. During this period, restaurants, cafes, shops and markets reduce their opening hours, which may not make it the most ideal time to visit. Even schools close early.

Non-Muslims aren‚Äôt expected to observe the fast, but out of respect should avoid drinking and snacking in the street. The exact month changes every year because it depends on the sightings of the moon, so check when Ramadan is expected before making your travel plans.</p>

<h2 class="destination">2.Bangkok Thailand</h2>
    <div class="description">Bangkok is the capital and most populous city of Thailand. It is known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon (Thai: ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏Ø), or simply Krung Thep (‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏Ø).

            The Grand Palace is probably the most important attraction in Bangkok ‚Äì ◊ë◊†◊í◊ß◊ï◊ß. Even if you are spending only a short time at the capital of Thailand, The Grand Palace is a must. It was built in 1782 and includes the holiest Buddhist temple in all of Thailand, Wat Phra Kaew. In the main chapel sits the Emerald Buddha, a statue of about 60 cm high. It is made of green jade that supposed to protect the land and its people. This Buddha has three different costumes, one for each season, so keep an eye out for the changing ceremony completed by the King at the beginning of each season! You could easily spend a whole day admiring the architecture, statues, and museums that make up the King‚Äôs official residence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Wat Pho, Bangkok
One of the most beautiful Buddhist temples in Bangkok, Wat Pho. You can find it in just a short walk from the Grand Palace. The stunning complex consists of a collection of prayer halls and pagodas. To make things more charming, it is divided into smaller walled areas. Above all, you can find the star attraction of the temple ‚Äì the Reclining Buddha. Not only it‚Äôs 46 meters long, but also 15 meters high! Also, superhuman granite statues guarding the various gates of the temple. They are of Chinese origin and are intended to represent how the Chinese introduced themselves to Europeans at the time
 </p>
 <p>
    Wat Arun, Bangkok ‚Äì ◊ë◊†◊í◊ß◊ï◊ß
You can find the Temple of the Dawn on the banks of the Chao Phraya River. Certainly, Wat Arun is one of the most romantic temples in Bangkok ‚Äì ◊ë◊†◊í◊ß◊ï◊ß. Despite its name, the temple is most beautiful when its silhouette stands out against the sky at sunset. The complex is dominated by a mighty, multi-level pagoda towering from its center, covered with Chinese porcelain pieces. During construction, the former king called on the population to donate their house porcelain. Apparently, the citizens eagerly followed his request. You can climb the Pagoda to about half the height. From there you can enjoy a great view of the river and the historical center of Bangkok ‚Äì ◊ë◊†◊í◊ß◊ï◊ß.
 </p>
 <p>
    The temple of Wat Saket is commonly referred to as the ‚ÄúGolden Mountain‚Äù. Once you see Wat Saket ‚Äì you‚Äôll understand very quickly why people call it that way. The approximately 60-meter-high elevation is crowned by a golden pagoda. Actually, it‚Äôs the result of a failed construction project. A Siamese king wanted to build the country‚Äôs tallest Pagoda in front of the former city gates of Bangkok ‚Äì ◊ë◊†◊í◊ß◊ï◊ß. However, the soft ground subsided under the weight, and the unfinished structure collapsed. But only in a later stage the ruin was secured and crowned with today‚Äôs Pagoda. You can climb over 300 steps, but no worries ‚Äì it worth it! You will enjoy a fantastic view!
 </p>
 <p>
    Canal Tour in Bangkok
If you want a glimpse of the traditional Thai life, take a boat tour on the canal. The boat rushes past stilt houses, temples, and tropical orchards where time seems to have stopped. Once a city of canals, Bangkok was nicknamed the ‚ÄúVenice of the East‚Äù. This vast network of artificial waterways was virtually the only way to transport people and goods. Only later on in the late 19th century, the first fixed road was paved in Bangkok ‚Äì ◊ë◊†◊í◊ß◊ï◊ß. Since then, almost all channels have been filled and converted into streets. However, there are still several canals left, primarily through the district of Thonburi. You can explore this old face of Bangkok as part of a boat tour.

 <figcaption>Bangkok at night</figcaption>
 <p>
    The legendary pop hit ‚ÄúOne Night in Bangkok‚Äù may sound like the ears of Bangkok‚Äôs nightlife. And indeed, Thailand‚Äôs capital is alive and kicking as the night has fallen. Many are drawn to the once infamous red-light districts such as Patpong, Nana Plaza, and Soi Cowboy. But do not worry, you can enjoy just a drink there. Alternatively, if you are more into dancing, you can visit Royal City Avenue (RCA), a whole Streets full of discos, pubs, and restaurants. Also, there‚Äôs a dinner cruise on the Chao Phraya River where the illuminated silhouette of Bangkok passes leisurely.
 </p>
 <p>
    Over 200,000 visitors stop by at one of the over 15,000 stalls. Indeed, Chatuchak Market is a mini-city in itself. But don‚Äôt let that put you off if you‚Äôre afraid of chaotic places. In fact, the maze-like market is carefully ordered to help you get to where you want to go. For example, head to sections 2-4, 23-24, and 26-27 for food stalls. Sections 2-6 have accessories and jewelry. Alternatively, if you are looking for antiques and collectibles go sections 1 and 26. Section 2 is closest to the MRT train station and gives a great insight into the scale of the market. It‚Äôs the perfect one for travelers who are short on time. Chatuchak is open weekends only, 09:00-18:00. 
 </p>
 <p>
    If you are curious about Asian art and history, you should visit the National Museum. Here you can see the authentic history of Thailand in chronological order. There are sculptures, mural paintings, and even royal artifacts to see. The museum is housed on the grounds of the former palace of the viceroy ‚Äì Wang Na Palace. Exhibits include weapons and uniforms, royal regalia, traditional musical instruments, as well as filigree religious artifacts. Worth to mention that some of the exhibits are dating back to the dawn of the first Siamese city-states in the 13th century. However, the top attractions are the incredible royal carriages and chariots that are still used on special occasions. Note that guided tours of art history and Buddhist Thailand are available every Wednesday and Thursday at 21:30.
 </p>
 <p>
    Temple of the Golden Buddha
For centuries, Thailand was a popular destination for Chinese immigrates. After all, it is said that about 80% of Bangkok‚Äôs current citizens have Chinese roots. The center of Chinese culture in Bangkok is the Yaowarat district, the largest Chinatown in the world! It is recommended to visit one of the temples built in Chinese architecture as well as a trip to Sampeng Lane, a narrow street with shops that mainly offer Chinese goods. Also, you should not miss a real Chinese meal in a small restaurant or at one of the countless street stalls. Finally, on the outskirts of Yaowarat, near Hualamphong Central Station, you can find the stunning Buddhist temple Wat Traimit. It houses a 500-year-old, 3.5 meters high Buddha statue.

<h3>Things to do in South Africa</h3>
<P>
   The Garden Route (Afrikaans: Tuinroete) is a 300-kilometre (190 mi)[1] stretch of the south-eastern coast of South Africa which extends from Witsand in the Western Cape to the border of Tsitsikamma Storms River in the Eastern Cape. The name comes from the verdant and ecologically diverse vegetation encountered here and the numerous estuaries and lakes dotted along the coast. It includes towns such as Witsand, Heidelberg, Riversdale, Stilbaai, Albertinia, Gouritsmond, Knysna, Plettenberg Bay, Mossel Bay, Oudtshoorn, Great Brak River, Little Brak River, Wilderness, Sedgefield and Nature's Valley; with George, the Garden Route's largest city and main administrative centre.

      It has an oceanic climate, with mild to warm summers, and mild to cool winters. Temperatures rarely fall below 10 ¬∞C in winter and rarely climb beyond 28 ¬∞C in summer. Rain occurs year-round, with a slight peak in the spring months, brought by the humid sea-winds from the Indian Ocean rising and releasing their precipitation along the Langeberg, Outeniqua and Tsitsikamma Mountains just inland of the coast. The Garden Route is closely linked with the Origin of Human Culture, due to archaeological finds in the Plettenberg Bay, Mossel Bay and Stilbaai areas.
      
      The Route is sandwiched between the aforementioned mountains and the Indian Ocean, with mountain passes, including the Outeniqua Pass and Garcia's Pass, linking the area with the arid Little Karoo. The Outeniqua, Grootvadersbosch and Tsitsikamma indigenous forests are a unique mixture of Cape Fynbos and Temperate Forest and offer hiking trails and eco-tourism activities. Nearly 300 species of birdlife are to be found in a variety of habitats ranging from fynbos to forest to wetlands.</p>

<p>Victoria Falls (Lozi: Mosi-oa-Tunya, "Thundering Smoke/Smoke that Rises"; Tonga: Shungu Namutitima, "Boiling Water") is a waterfall on the Zambezi River, located on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe.[2] It is one of the world's largest waterfalls, with a width of 1,708 m (5,604 ft). The region around it has a high degree of biodiversity in both plants and animals.

   Archaeology and oral history describe a long record of African knowledge of the site. Although known to some European geographers before the 19th century, Scottish missionary David Livingstone identified the falls in 1855, naming them Victoria Falls after Queen Victoria. Since the mid-20th century, the site has been a major tourist destination. Zambia and Zimbabwe both have national parks and tourism infrastructure at the site. Research in the late 2010s found that precipitation variability due to climate change is likely to alter the character of the falls.  </p>
   <p>Victoria Falls is classified as the largest based on its combined width of 1,708 metres (5,604 ft)[7] and height of 108 metres (354 ft),[8] resulting in the world's largest sheet of falling water.

      For a considerable distance upstream from the falls, the Zambezi flows over a level sheet of basalt in a shallow valley, bounded by low and distant sandstone hills. The river's course is dotted with numerous tree-covered islands, which increase in number when the river approaches the falls. There is a flat plateau extending in all directions.
      
      The falls are formed where the full width of the river plummets in a single vertical drop into a transverse chasm 1,708 metres (5,604 ft) wide, carved along a fracture zone in the basalt plateau. The depth of the chasm, called the First Gorge, varies from 80 metres (260 ft) at its western end to 108 metres (354 ft) in the centre. The only outlet from the First Gorge is a 110-metre-wide (360 ft) gap about two-thirds of the way across the width of the falls from the western end. The whole volume of the river pours into the Victoria Falls gorges from this narrow cleft.[9]
      
      Two islands on the crest of the falls: Boaruka Island (or Cataract Island) near the western bank, and Livingstone Island near the middle. At less than full flood, additional islets divide the curtain of water into separate parallel streams. The main streams are named, in order from Zimbabwe (west) to Zambia (east): the Devil's Cataract[9] (called Leaping Water by some), the Main Falls, the Rainbow Falls (the highest) and the Eastern Cataract.

      The River Zambezi, upstream from the falls, experiences a rainy season from late November to early April, and a dry season the rest of the year. The river's annual flood season is February to May with a peak in April.[10] The spray from the falls typically rises to a height of over 400 metres (1,300 ft), sometimes up to twice as high, and is visible from up to 50 km (30 mi) away. At full moon, a "moonbow" can also be seen. During the flood season, however, the foot and the face of the waterfall can't be seen.[11]
      
      When the dry season takes effect, the islets on the crest become wider and more numerous. From September to January, up to half of the rocky face of the falls may become dry, allowing the bottom of the First Gorge to be seen along most of its length. At this time, it becomes possible (though not necessarily safe) to walk across some stretches of the river at the crest. It is also possible to walk to the bottom of the First Gorge at the Zimbabwean side. The minimum flow, which occurs in November, is around a tenth of the April figure; this variation in flow is greater than that of other major falls and causes the Victoria Falls' annual average flow rate to be lower than might be expected based on the maximum flow.[11] In 2019 unusually low rain dramatically reduced the fall to the lowest flow in a century. Global climate change and changed climate patterns are suggested to have caused this.</p>
